## Module 8/ ETL - Extract, Transform, Load
### Purpose

The company Amazing Prime extremely likes the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. We need to help Britta create an automated pipeline that takes in the new data/ performs the transfromations/ and loads the data into existing tables. We had to refactor the code from this walk through module in order to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—--and then performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
